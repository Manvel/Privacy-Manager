## Privacy Manager extension

Privacy Manager Extension itself doesn't collect any user data, however your browser might collect some data (for example updates to Privacy Manager for Chrome are handled by the Google Web Store website and are subject to the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)).

## Chrome Web Store listing(installation page)

[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) listing analytics is used, that includes information about the traffic sources to the [Privacy Manager listing and listing page visits](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-manager/giccehglhacakcfemddmfhdkahamfcmd). That information is used to improve the listing performance for example by analyzing the language demand of the users visiting the listing, to provide more translations for the extension depending on the language demand of the visitors and general impression/installation data provided by Chrome Web Store.
